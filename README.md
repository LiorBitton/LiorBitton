Hello, my name is Lior Bitton, I am a 18 years old computer science student.

* EverScout - An Android application used to capture FRC match data in real time, the data is stored in Firebase and can be accessed via python in order to be analysed and visually presented.
* FRC-Scouting - Same Functionality that EverScout has just made using flutter and designed to be modular and customised for each FRC game.
* Spotify Playlist Downloader - Allows Downloading a playlist from spotify using web scraping.
* puns bot - A twitter bot that uploads a pun to twitter everyday(not active right now).
